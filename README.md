# AI for Engineers - Course Resources

Welcome to the AI for Engineers course! This repository contains resources, research papers, and trending topics for each week of the course.

## Course Project
We'll be building an AI-Powered Code Review Assistant throughout the course. Each week builds upon the previous week's progress:
- Week 1: Basic code analysis using LLMs and prompt engineering
- Week 2: Enhanced with RAG to incorporate coding standards and best practices
- Week 3: Fine-tuned for specific programming languages and patterns
- Week 4: Deployed as an automated code review agent

## Weekly Resources
- [Week 1: LLMs and Prompt Engineering](./week1/README.md)
- [Week 2: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](./week2/README.md)
- [Week 3: Fine-tuning](./week3/README.md)
- [Week 4: Agents and Deployment](./week4/README.md)
